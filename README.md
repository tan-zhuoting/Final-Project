# Chemistry Compound Geometry Analysis
## PIC 10C Final Project

I am a chemistry major student and I've been doing computational chemistry calculations in my research lab. I usually use Softwares like Gaussian 16.0 to calculate the reaction energies, reaction dynamics, and compound geometries. I want to make a C++ program that can simulate such calculations so I can run a quick calculation on my computer without sending it to the cluster. I also want to design it to eliminate unnecessary steps so I can obtain my output files faster than calculating them using the software. The program will include constructing the periodic table, atomic bond length, bond angles, energy and geometry analysis, etc. 

## Goals: 
Write a computer program to take a set of atomic symbols and Cartesian coordinates
for a collection of atoms and determine all possible interatomic distances and bond angles. Assume
the coordinates are provided in Angstroms.
